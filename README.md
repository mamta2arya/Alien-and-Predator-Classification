# Alien-and-Predator-Classification

The dataset Alien vs. Predator images comes from Kaggle. Each class (alien and predator) contains 247 training images and 100 validation images. The images are JPG files with a size of around 250x250 pixels. Letâ€™s use those to build a Neural Network that can classify them!

Convolutional Neural Network will be used here to classify between the images of Alein vs Predator
